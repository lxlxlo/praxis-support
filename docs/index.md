## Primary Features

* **Media neutral architecture**. Built from the ground up for working with multiple media, using an architecture based around models for distributed processing.
* **Intuitive patcher-style graphical editor**. Fast visual project building with drag-and-drop creation of components and connections.
* **Edit everything live**. Built around the central concept that everything should be editable at run time.
* **Optimized video pipeline**, including a range of pixel effects and blend modes, with software and OpenGL rendering.
* **Low latency audio support**, including JACK binding.
* **Custom GUI's and MIDI/OSC control**. Create custom controls panels bound to any parameter, or control any parameter using a MIDI or OSC controller.
* **Live coding**. For when the built-in component don't offer all you need, create custom components 'on-the-fly' using Java / Processing or GLSL.
